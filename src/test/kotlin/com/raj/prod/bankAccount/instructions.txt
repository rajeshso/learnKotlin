The Digital Wallet should be implemented in Kotlin, and you should use functional programming principles to organize your code.

The wallet should be able to create user accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer funds between accounts.

Each user account should have a unique identifier, such as an account number or username, and should store the user's balance.

The Digital Wallet should validate user input and ensure that users cannot transfer more funds than they have available in their account.

When a user transfers funds, the Digital Wallet should update the account balances for both the sender and the recipient.

You should write unit tests to ensure that your code works as expected.

It's a good idea to use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.
